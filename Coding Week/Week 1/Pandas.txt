1. How do I read a tabular data file into pandas?
-> tab separated assumed generally.
-> head() gives first 5 rows.
-> but we can give parameter as the separator.
-> we can have our defined columns name as well.
-> does it only read table? or does it read everything but structure it in a table?

2. How do I select a pandas series from a dataframe?
-> two object types in pandas: series and dataframe
-> series are columns of the dataframe
-> csv file by default comma separated
-> if there are columns name such that it has space in it or if it is built in function name, then we can't access it with dot method, we have to go for bracket method
-> example: ufo['City'] or ufo.City
-> bracket notation much better as it helps in adding new columns too which are combination of old columns

3. Why do some pandas commands end with parentheses, and other commands don't?
-> describe() function requires atleast one numerical column to show the statistics
-> dataframes/series have methods and attributes: methods are sort of actions and attributes are the properties
-> if we want to know what the method or attribute does, we can click on the bracket start '(') and then tap, 'shift+tab'

4. How do I rename columns in a pandas DataFrame?
-> use inplace to make it permanent

5. How do I remove columns from a pandas DataFrame?
-> var.shape tells rows and columns
-> drop method helps in removing a column
-> multiple columns can be dropped simultaneously
-> rows can also be deleted by drop function!
-> default value of axis=0 for rows; have to mention 1 for columns

6. How do I sort a pandas DataFrame or Series?
-> sort_values() is a series method, asc by default
-> if not in place mentioned, series not affected
-> example: movies['title'].sort_values() (SERIES)
-> example: movies.sort_values('title') (DF)

7. How do I filter rows of a pandas DF by column value?
-> example: movies[movies.duration>=200]
-> datatype is Series (inner part)
-> outer part gives a dataframe with the filtered rows

8. How do I apply multiple filter criteria to a pandas DF?
-> conditions need to be put inside the bracket and conditions connected by '&', '|'
-> isin() method is series method

9. Questions answered.

10. How do I use the "axis" parameter in pandas?

11. How do I use string methods in pandas?
-> String handling section!!

12. How do I change the data type of a pandas series?
-> example: drinks['beer_servings']=drinks.beer_servings.astype(float)

13. When should I use a groupby in pandas?

14. How do I explore a pandas Series?
-> note: movies.describe and movies.describe() - both give a different outputs. one is a table description and other is a statistics one.

15. How do I handle missing values in pandas?
-> missing values excluded in value_counts generally
-> we can assign them values too

16. What do I know about the pandas index?
-> index == row labels, and column headers == column names
-> identification, alignment and selection
-> particular cell value => loc[index,column_name]

17. How do I select multiple rows and columns from a pandas DF?
-> loc is for selecting things by label: req 2 parameters
-> if one row is extracted => it will be a series
-> iloc also works similar as loc but with numerical indexing
-> iloc is exclusive notation: [A,B)
-> loc is inclusive notation: [A,B]
 
18. When should I use the "inplace" parameter in pandas?

19. How do I make my pandas DataFrame smaller and faster?
-> objects stored as integers by converting to category type
-> if object column has less number of strings then in that case we convert it to category

20. How do I use pandas with scikit-learn to create Kaggle submissions?
-> Predict the survival rate of a passenger (Kaggle Competition)

21. How do I create dummy variables in pandas?
-> if there are n values then there will be n-1 dummy variables
